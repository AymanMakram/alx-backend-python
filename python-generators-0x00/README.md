# Python Generators, Decorators, Context Managers, and Async Programming

## Project Overview

This project explores advanced Python programming techniques - **generators**, **decorators**, **context managers**, and **asynchronous programming** - focusing on how they improve performance, readability, and maintainability in large-scale applications.

As part of this exercise, we implement a script `seed.py` that:

- Sets up a MySQL database called **`ALX_prodev`**.  
- Creates a table **`user_data`**.  
- Populates the table with data from a CSV file (`user_data.csv`).  
- Demonstrates a **Python generator** that streams rows from the database one by one.
